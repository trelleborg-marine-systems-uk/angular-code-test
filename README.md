## Test Brief

To gain an idea of developer capability in understanding and developing with technologies currently used at Trelleborg Marine Systems UK, this project will cover 
some key aspects of Angular. It should be noted - this is not a timed test, there is no expectation the developer should have pre-existing knowledge of Angular, 
this provides a demonstration of problem solving, self-sufficiency and task completion.

When completing a task please use: `//` or `<!-- -->` with TASK: [TASK Number] indicating the area that completes the task.  

e.g

`<!-- TASK: 1 Add heading to Home component -->`

`<h1>I Added a Heading</h1>`

or 

`// TASK: 2 Populate list with things`

`let listOfThings = {"thingOne","thingTwo"}`

### Tasks

1. The title in the card on Home and List pages differ. Think of a solution to fix this.
2. Align the buttons in the footers to the right.
3. Having static information in the list does not allow for easy updating - Can this be remedied using Angular.
